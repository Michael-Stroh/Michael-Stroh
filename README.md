# A short paragraph about me
<pre>
         Michael StrÃ¶h has learnt throughout his university career that perseverance leads to
         excellence. Through working as a Teaching Assistant for COS 212 (Data Structures)
         and a Student Lab Technician in the CBT labs at the University Of Pretoria he has
         learnt how to manage his time wisely and effectively communicate not only as a team
         but also as an individual. As an Artificial Intelligence project Michael StrÃ¶h 
         successfully completed a Sudoku solver using Generic Algorithms and a flower 
         specimens classifier using Machine Learning with back propagation to identify 
         the different species of the iris flower, namely, iris setosa, iris versicolour 
         and iris virginica.

# Recent Project

While I am involved in a lot of projects I am not always allowed to share these projects publicly.

One of the more recent projects I have been apart of was for my final year project, COS 301 at UP.
This project involved creating a virtual version of the popular geocaching activity with a few interesting twists.

You can navigate to the following link to find out more about it and how I participated in it: <br>

There are also a lot of other amazing projects that was done for the same course at UP that I recommend you look at: <br>
